"""Operation-specific argument validation, run before approval *and* before dispatch (WP13).

One validator, two call sites
----------------------------
:func:`check` is the only validator in this plugin. The ``pre_tool_call`` hook
(``microsoft365.registration``) calls it before it can return an approval directive, and the
tool dispatch path calls it again immediately before a handler is looked up, so the same
payload gets the same answer before approval and before any handler, secret, credential or
Graph client is touched. It is deliberately the same function with the same arguments — not a
second, weaker check — and it never mutates or normalizes the payload: the arguments that were
approved are the arguments that are executed (R5).

What it rejects
---------------
* a call whose arguments are not an object; an unknown operation; an operation disabled by
  configuration; an authentication mode the operation does not support (or that is not
  implemented at all);
* any property the operation does not declare, any missing required property, and ``None``
  where a value is required;
* coercion: ``True``/``1``/``"false"`` are not booleans, a number or a list is not an
  identifier, a string is not an integer;
* empty, unbounded, unstripped or control-character-carrying strings; collections beyond their
  bounded size; recipients that are not addresses; paths that are absolute, traversing,
  backslashed or addressed; timestamps that are not ISO-8601 date-times (a naive one is
  accepted only when the operation also carries ``time_zone``); time zones that are not a
  plausible zone name; ETags that are blank, wildcards or header-injection attempts;
* base64 that is not padded base64, is larger than the encoded ceiling, or would decode larger
  than the decoded ceiling — both size gates run **before** any decode of the payload;
* a PATCH that is empty, carries a field outside the operation's allowlist, or carries ``None``
  or a nested object as a value;
* mutually exclusive argument forms (exactly one, or at most one, of the declared forms);
* ``/me`` as a user id in application mode, and a user-scoped operation with no user id at all.

What it may never leak
----------------------
A rejection message is assembled from static templates plus a **bounded, sanitized name** of
the offending argument. No value from the payload is ever interpolated: a rejected value cannot
appear in the message, in the tool result or in a log line built from it. Values are always
described by their kind and their bound, never by their content.

No credential surface
---------------------
This module never reads a secret, never builds a credential and never builds a Graph client —
it imports neither the host's scoped secret lookup, the credential library, nor the Graph client
library (pinned by test), so the guard sits strictly in front of that whole surface. It imports
only the operation registry, the argument-free settings record and the error taxonomy.
